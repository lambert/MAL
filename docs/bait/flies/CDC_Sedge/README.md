Catch the thread onto the hook shank.

Wind the thread in touching turns to the bend and back to form a body.

Take a CDC feather, stroke the fibres against the natural direction and cut the tip of the feather as shown above.

Stroke the fibres back and tie them in such manner that the shaft is not tied in.
