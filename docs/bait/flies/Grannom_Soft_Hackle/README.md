## Introduction

![main](main.jpg)

One of the key factors for me was getting the color of the egg sac correct.

After a bit of correspondence with Mike Conner, from the UK, he let me know that the key color is a dark emerald green.

Once I picked a silk that went to that color when wet, it made all the difference.

Funny what the fish will find as a key element in a fly.
