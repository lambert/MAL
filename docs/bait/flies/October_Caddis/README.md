## Introduction

![main](main.jpg)

While not a Great Smoky Mountain original, this version of a caddis dry
fly has been very popular in the park for decades.
These caddis hatch in a number of streams in the area, with perhaps the
most notable hatch in Abrams Creek.
An overall great fall pattern for many areas of the country.
