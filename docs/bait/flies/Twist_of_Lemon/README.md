## Introduction

![main](main.jpg)

This fly uses a special technique where a strand of floss and a strand
of tinsel is twisted together before the combo is wound on the hook
shank.
The rope - if twisted regularly enough - will form a nice segmented body
with built in ribbing.
The name of the fly is divised from this technique and the fact that
it's made mainly from yellow materials.
A similar fly without the twisted body is Orange Twist.

### Tying the fly

Start with a hook.

Cover the hook shank with a smooth layer of light thread.
Let the thread hang down to reach the hook point

Tie in a strip of narrow silver tinsel and wind it to reach a point
above the point of the barb and back

Tie down and cut surplus

Take a strand of yellow floss and a similar strand of oval silver tinsel

Tie in both at the tag

Wind the thread forwards, form a smooth foundation of thread for the
body

Twist the floss and tinsel counterclockwise using hackle pliers.

The twist should form a tight and even rope

Wind the rope forwards in close and even turns to a point 1/4 shank
length behind the hook eye

Tie down and cut surplus

Dub some red flash dubbing on the thread and form a short, dense thorax

Tie in a yellow hackle, tip first and hackle stem upwards

Wind the hackle clockwise in wet fly style, folding it over and stroking
barbs to the rear of the hook

2-3 turns will suffice depending on the hackle

Tie down and cut surplus

Whip finish the light thread and tie in the black

Form a nice, small head from black tying thread

Whip finish and varnish ...
