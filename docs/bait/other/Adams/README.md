# The Adams River Fly

## Introduction

This American import is now, quite probably, the most popular and widely used dry-fly in the UK.

Its success lies in the fact that it is a superb general representation of a whole range of upwinged flies and so can be used with confidence on an almost limitless number of waters.

While the combination of grey and brown might not seem ideal for imitating flies that are mostly various shades of olive, the Adams still manages to tempt fish whether they are feeding on a variety of food forms or whether they are targeting a specific hatch.

The blend of grizzle and brown cock hackle fibres seems particularly effective and with the addition of grizzle hackle tips for the wings the Adams is a very lively looking fly.

The Adams is tied in a range of forms, from the standard one with hackle-point wings and a collar hackle to parachute and thorax-tied versions.

In the latter the hackle is tied in open turns rather than as a dense ruff.

The technique produces a sparser more natural looking fly that is well suited for fishing smooth glides.

Given that the pattern can be used to suggest any number of upwinged species, it is tied in a very large range of sizes.

A size 8 makes a reasonable representation of a Mayfly while, tied right through to a size 22, it can cover even the smallest Caenis or iron blue.

## Where to fish

As it is such a general fly pattern, it will catch fish on any river or stream.

It is invariably fished on or in the surface as a dry-fly or emerger pattern.

## When to fish

It will work right throughout the season whenever either trout or grayling are prepared to feed on the surface.

## How to fish

Fished singly on a floating line and a tapered leader, it is either dead-drifted upstream or, where permissible, fly-first downstream.

It can be used to target individual rising fish or used as a search pattern when drifted over a likely looking spot.

### Tying tip

When tying in hackle-point wings, always fold the bare stems and bind them down before removing the excess.

This stops the wings slipping out.
