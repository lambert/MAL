# Abu Garcia Suveran Uptide Rod

Anglers around the world have trusted Abu Garcia to put their equipment through the toughest tests for
generations; as a result, their designs are incredibly reliable and durable.
Their innovative products are crafted and designed specifically for anglers like yourself, so you can
be confident they perform brilliantly on the bank or shore.
The original Suveran Evo Uptide Rod was hugely popular and with its new improvements, this one is too;
charter boat skippers love them and it’s easy to see why this sea fishing rod is such a success.

The new and improved Suveran Evo Uptide Rod now has an all-new multi-dynamic IM6 carbon blank.
The carbon itself makes the rod strong and sturdy, enough to withstand even the strongest and most
aggressive of bites, and also suitable for a braid line.
The blank is exceptionally light with a slim diameter so its power won’t compromise the rod’s overall
lightweight feel at 514kg that Abu Garcia strive for.

This rod has excellent bite indication thanks to its highly responsive and sensitive tip which will alert
you as soon as there’s something on the end on your line, so you’ll never miss a bite.
To enhance this, it also has a steely mid-section and stiff butt which offers optimum performance with both
braid and mono lines alike.
This sea fishing rod will also protect your line thanks to the Fuji SiC guides that will elevate your line
away from your rod and eliminate any chances of friction occurring, this will greatly reduce the damage to
your line and prolong its life whilst preventing any damage to your rod.

Comfort is key with this rod. It has a Hi-Grade EVA handle; this is soft material that will not hurt your
hand after an extended period of use.
You can firmly grip your rod without the issue of your hand aching later on after hauling in lots of powerful
heavy fish.
The rod can also be packed down into two sections; this makes transporting the rod in your luggage easier and
more convenient, and assembling it is a breeze too.

Abu Garcia’s ideal saltwater rod comes well equipped with a carbon woven DPS reel seat.
With this convenient seat, you can easily attach your reel to your rod and you’ll be reeling in the bigger fish
in no time thanks to the combined power of this outstanding rod and your reel; they will work perfectly well
together.
The reel seat is woven with carbon which makes it extremely durable and long lasting; wear and tear from
attaching and removing your reel won’t be a problem for you.

With a casting weight of 5-10 oz, you can really customize the amount of bait you choose to cast.
You can go all out when distributing to an area teeming with fish as it easily handles large cod baits and this
rod will be able to support the weight of the bait with ease; you can distribute it powerfully and accurately
so you can get that bait exactly where you want it.

A unique feature of this sea fishing rod is the exceptional twist and lock butt section that extends further,
this allows for even easier and smoother casting thanks to the extra length.

At 9.9 ft, this rod has a huge amount of power.
It is absolutely great for hauling in large cod, rays and conger with no trouble at all. With this rod, you’ll
be reeling in the big ones and leaving the smaller ones to the dust.
This rod can even easily deal with strong tides, so you won’t ever have to compromise an angling session
because the sea isn’t co-operating, because your rod is on your side.
