# Tronixpro Xenon Travel

With airlines charging more for taking excess luggage, including large rod tubes, the
Xenon Travel is the perfect travelling companion for the worldwide angler.
It breaks down into six sections, meaning it will fit easily into most hold luggage
cases.
This small package makes it convenient for taking on family holidays where room for
fishing tackle is limited.
It’s also a fantastic rod to leave in the boot of the car for those impromptu sessions.
Despite the multiple sections, we have worked hard to produce a fluid, fast and
powerful blank that has the same powerflow as a traditional two or three-piece rod.
At home it is the ideal rod for catching bass, bream, whiting, flatfish and garfish.
Whilst abroad, it would have no problem catching small and medium sized species but
with the added reserves of power in the butt, would be able to tackle larger species
such as rays and fast running fish.
